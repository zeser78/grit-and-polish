                            the longer your removal will last. Think two full weeks from a shave.</li>
                        <li>You should not wax if taking skin sensitive medicines such as Accutane, Retin-A</li>
                        <li>Taking an ibruprofen 30-40 minutes prior to service could reduce pain.</li>
                        <li>Do not apply heavy creams or oils to skin before wax. Removal area should be clean and dry.</li>

                    <h2>Bitten Nail Restoration</h2>

                    <p class="grit">Nail biting is a treatable condition called Onychophagia and is considered an impulse control disorder.
                        Some people with chronic Onychophagia bite fingernails and the surrounding skin until they bleed.
                        Others bite and pick until they have literally removed an entire nail. One problem with nail biting
                        is that it&#39;s considered socially undesirable. </p>
                    <p class="grit">Social stigma aside, experts say gnawing on your nails could lead to some scary health issues. When biting
                        your nails you transfer bacteria back and forth between the mouth and fingers, which isn&#39;t where
                        you want germs. To begin with, your nails harbor all sorts of germs. In particular, a family of bacteria
                        called &quot;enterobacteriaceae&quot; which includes salmonella and E. coli. says Richard Scher,
                        M.D., an expert on nail disorders at Weill Cornell Medical College and a member of the American Academy
                        of Dermatology.</p>
                    <p class="grit">The perils of nail biting also extend to your teeth. Constant biting can lead to poor dental occlusion,
                        so the biter’s teeth shift out of position or become oddly shaped, Scher says. Biters also suffer
                        from higher rates of gum disease and infection, he adds.</p>

                    <h4>What Does The Program Involve?</h4>
                    <p class="grit">The aim of the Bitten Nails Restoration Program is to support and re-educate you so once you have achieved
                        your goal you can continue to have beautiful, strong healthy nails.</p>
                    <p class="grit">On your initial appointment we will explain the program in full and we will discuss your individual circumstances
                        and apply your sculpted gel set.</p>
                    <p class="grit">You will then continue to return every week to have a gel fill. This is very important for the maintenance
                        of your natural nails and of course you will have obvious re-growth. A gel fill includes gentle removal
                        of the existing gel using an electric buffer so no damage to the natural nail or skin is caused,
                        followed by a fresh professional application of UV gel.</p>
