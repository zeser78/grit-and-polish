            <p>Is there a teen in your life who struggles with acne? This is the perfect time to get a young person on a path to clearer and healthier skin before school starts this fall. </p>
            <p>First you should understand what causes acne breakouts. Acne is caused by a build-up of oil, dead skin cells, and the acne causing bacteria P. acnes trapped in the pore. Additionally, those who experience adult acne are likely seeing it as a result of hormonal fluctuations.</p>
            <p>At Grit + Polish we offer a Clinical Acne Treatment featuring PCA products. A therapeutic facial focused on congested, acne-prone, skin in need of extractions followed by an anti-bacterial high frequency treatment to correct and prevent blemishes.</p>
            <p>Our Senior Aesthetician Christiane "Chris" Faria de Paula has two decades of experience, and a bedside manner that will reassure every teen.  She offers the following great advice.</p>
            <h3>DON'T.....</h3>
            
            <p><b>OVER EXFOLIATE. </b> Keep your teen’s skincare routine simple: Cleanser, toner (one without alcohol), moisturizer, and spot treatment.<p>
            <p><b>SWITCH UP PRODUCTS TOO OFTEN. </b>They reclaimed their leading role and are now coming back thicker and bushier than ever. The most daring show them messy. This could disrupt previous trends in 2018.</p>
            <p><b>TOUCH YOUR FACE. </b> If your teen is a chronic face-toucher keeping their hands away from their skin will absolutely help improve their skin.</p>
             <h3>DO.....</h3>
            <p><b>WATCH WHAT SHE EATS. </b>VYour teen should avoid spicy foods and drink plenty of water.</p>
            <p><b>KEEP YOUR TEEN’S SKIN CARE REGIMENT SIMPLE.</b>Look for products with a mix of Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinol, and Niacinamide. At Grit+ Polish we have available for retail the PCA Acne Kit.</p>
            <p><b>WASH FACE LAST. </b>When it comes to bathing, many of us use conditioner as the last step. For acne-prone skin this is one of the worst things. Conditioner leaves a filmy substance on skin that will cause sensitive, acneic types to breakout. Therefore, cleansing the face – and back – should be the last thing your teen does before turning off the water. </p>
            <p><b>MOISTURIZE. </b>The idea that acne-prone skin doesn’t need moisturizer is a myth. In fact, that usually causes the skin to overcompensate and create more oil, causing more breakouts. Instead, choose a very gentle, oil-free cream that hydrates without adding any active ingredients that could irritate the problem.</p>
            <p><b>SPOT TREATMENT. </b>Have your teen apply spot treatments before full-face treatments. This allows for better penetration of the potent ingredients in acne spot treatments. At Grit+ Polish we have available for retail PCA Acne Gel for spot treatments.</p>
            <p><b>CHANGE PILLOWCASES DAILY. </b>Pillowcases can house dirt and oil that can get into your teen's pores as they sleep, leading to breakouts.</p>
            <p><b>PRACTICE SUN SAFETY. </b>The sun can really damage their skin (as can tanning beds). Make sure she wears a product with SPF in it every day. </p>
            <p><b>CLEAN CELLPHONE CASE EVERY WEEK. </b>Cellphones are covered with bacteria and dirt, which is then transferred to our faces when we press our phones to our ear.</p>
            <p><b>WASH MAKEUP BRUSHES WEEKLY. </b>If your teen doesn’t have a makeup brush cleaner, she can use facial wash to clean her brushes instead.</p>
            <p><b>CLEANSER IN LOCKER. </b>Have your teen keep a cleanser or cleansing cloth in their locker at school or in their sports bag so they can clean their faces following exercise or sports practices.</p>
