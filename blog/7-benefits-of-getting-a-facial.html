            <p>A good daily care routine is essential for maintaining a healthy looking, fresh skin, but once in a while we need to leave it to the professionals and get a facial treatment at a beauty salon or spa.</p>
            <p>No matter the type, all facials have some amazing benefits for your skin:</p>
            
            
            <div>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">1) DEEP CLEANSING</h3>
              <p>A better, deeper cleanse than the one you do at home – a cleansing facial will help you get rid of oil buildup, toxins and dirt from your everyday environment, thoroughly removing all the bacteria that could cause skin issues. A good exfoliation like microdermabrasion will remove dead skin cells from the surface of your skin and unclog your pores, allowing the absorption of other products. This will also make your skin look and feel softer and smoother, making your makeup blend easier and look better. Extraction, if needed, is great for removing blackheads, whiteheads, pimples and preventing breakouts.</p>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">2) ANTI-AGING</h3>
              <p>Facial treatments can help slow down the aging process and prevent the appearance of wrinkles. Massaging your face with an anti-aging cream will immediately increase the blood circulation and oxygen flow, which promotes collagen production and enhances the elasticity of your skin. This leads to a reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and preventing their appearance.</p>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">3) RELAXATION</h3>
              <p>Massages are so good for relaxing, relieving stress and balancing your mind. Just like your body, your face muscles need massage and most facial treatments include one. The boost in circulation you’ll get will stimulate the lymphatic vessels and detoxify your skin, making it look healthy and youthful.</p>
             
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">4) SKIN REJUVENATION</h3>
              <p>The exfoliation, extraction, massage, steam and mask application during a facial treatment lead to skin rejuvenation, or in other words – a fresh, renewed skin. This improves the appearance of the skin, giving it a healthy, radiant glow and balanced complexion.</p>
              <p>Files and buffers used in pedicures are single use.</p>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">5) IMPROVED SKIN CARE ROUTINE</h3>
              <p>A good esthetician will analyse your skin condition and help you choose the best facial treatment for your skin type. You can pick up some good advice by a professional, talk about your daily skin care routine and get recommendations on which products would work best for your skin.</p>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">6) TREATING SKIN ISSUES</h3>
              <p>After being diagnosed with a skin condition, getting a regular facial treatment will help treat it and heal your skin. Issues like blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, sunspots and sun damage, acne, inflammation and redness, rosacea, dehydration, wrinkles, acne scarring, loss of firmness and elasticity can be minimized or completely treated with the right facial treatment.</p>
              <h3 style="text-align: left; margin: 0;">7) TREAT YOURSELF</h3>
              <p>Having a little time for pampering yourself in a peaceful environment will definitely uplift your spirit and clear your mind. So take some time off and treat yourself!!!</p>
              <h3>HOW OFTEN DO YOU NEED FACIALS?</h3>
              <p>It depends on several factors such as:</p>
              <p><b>Your skin type: </b>if you have oily skin that’s prone to acne and breakouts, you need a facial treatment once in every two weeks. And in case you have combination, dry, or normal skin, once every month is fine. </p>
            <p><b>The condition of your skin: </b>Do you have blackheads or dull skin? Or acne and hyperpigmentation? The frequency of your facial treatments depends on the problem you have.</p>
            <p><b>Skin care goals: </b> if you want beautiful and younger looking skin for a lifetime, you should start early. Follow the facial routine religiously as suggested by the esthetician. If you are someone who is concerned about the appearance of your skin, you should take facial routines seriously.</p>
            <p><b>Your budget: </b>your budget affects your skin care routine. If you have a tight budget, try getting a facial done once every two months.</p>
